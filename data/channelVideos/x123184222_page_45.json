I am with my camera and I have taken dozens of pictures of what I am seeing here. I know that the buffalo race is the only event in the world. It's a very unique one. And it's great. It's fantastic,\" she says. \r\nThe races are fun and festive, but jockeys take the matters quite seriously. \r\nThe animals go through months of training ahead of the event. \r\nThe buffalos are divided into five different age groups with total of 80 buffalo hitting the tracks. \r\nWinners from each group take a modest sum of 230 USD cash prize home. \r\nThe tradition of buffalo racing started about a century ago when farmers gathered to celebrate the end of the ploughing season and before the harvest.\r\nNirut Sutjarith, a buffalo owner says \"I am glad that the event is held every year so we can pass on this tradition to the next generations.\"\r\nAnother owner Suthep Theechitmachart, says he treats his animals like his children. \r\n\"I raise these buffalos like my own young children. They eat better than me. Sometimes I went hungry but had to find them good, find them grass, and take good care of them. If they are hot, I turn on the electric fans for them. I spent a hundred thousand baht (approx. 3,000$)  building the shed.\"\r\nAuthorities promote the race, in order to help keep the traditional farming methods alive.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/0e341f6c122f0dc33530796cafaf292a \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

            "description": "(4 Oct 2017) Minutes into the playoff debut for these young New York Yankees, they trailed Minnesota by three runs. Their starting pitcher lasted just one out. A sellout crowd was stunned.\r\nCould their postseason be over almost before it began?\r\nNope. A strange AL wild-card game was only just beginning.\r\n\"We've had a quite a few games where we've gotten down early,\" Aaron Judge said. \"Just keep battling. Just stay calm. Just play your game, and good things will happen.\"\r\nJudge, Didi Gregorius and a brilliant bullpen rescued New York and lifted the Yankees to their first postseason victory in five years.\r\n                Gregorius' three-run homer tied the score in the first inning after Minnesota knocked out Luis Severino, a pumped-up Judge showed his most emotion this season when he hit a two-run shot in his playoff debut and the Yankees beat the Twins 8-4 Tuesday night. New York plays the Indians in a best-of-five Division Series starting Thursday.\r\n\"We're not done yet,\" Judge said. \"We've just got to keep it rolling in Cleveland.\"\r\n                Brett Gardner also homered for the Yankees, who chased Ervin Santana after two innings and once again eliminated Minnesota from the playoffs.\r\nChad Green, David Robertson, Tommy Kahnle and Aroldis Chapman combined for 8 2\/3 innings of one-run, five-hit relief, striking out 13 to tie the postseason record for a bullpen.\r\n\"It was just remarkable,\" Yankees manager Joe Girardi said.\r\nTwins manager Paul Molitor marveled at the Yankees relievers and Girardi's use of them over 142 pitches.\r\n\"He extended some guys probably past their comfort zone,\" the Hall of Famer said. \"They still performed.\"\r\n                Brian Dozier led off the game with a home run and Eddie Rosario hit a two-run drive as the Twins burst to a quick lead.\r\nBut Santana went to full counts on eight of 11 batters, and he was removed after six outs and 64 pitches with the Twins trailing 4-3.\r\n\"It's the exhilaration of jumping out,\" Molitor said, \"and then the deflation of giving it back so quickly.\"\r\nMinnesota, the first team to follow a 100-loss season with a playoff appearance, lost its 13th consecutive postseason game, tying the record set by Boston from 1986-95. The Twins have been eliminated by the Yankees in five of their last six postseason appearances and have not won a playoff series since 2002.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/33414d68cadd07665615f01c1b5f5d1b \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

                "description": "(5 Oct 2017) Pope Francis has denounced how new technologies are making it easier for people to change gender, saying this \"utopia of the neutral\" risks the creation of new life.\r\nFrancis made the comments on Thursday to the Pontifical Academy for Life, the Vatican's bioethics advisory board, taking up his criticism of so-called gender theory and the idea that people can choose their sex.\r\nThe academy under the previous two popes represented the leading, hard line voice of the Catholic Church on sexual ethics, morality and culture war issues such as abortion and euthanasia.\r\n Francis has revamped it to broaden its scope to better reflect his holistic view of human life in concert with creation.\r\nBut Francis kept to the church's hard line against gender theory in his first meeting with the new members Thursday.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/029df7c82ebdedaca1dea962f747f1ff \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
