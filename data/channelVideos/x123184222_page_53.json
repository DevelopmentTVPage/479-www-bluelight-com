            "description": "(23 Sep 2017) AUDREY HEPBURN'S PERSONAL ITEMS TO BE AUCTIONED IN LONDON \r\nAudrey Hepburn introduced the world to the concept of the 'little black dress', statement jewellery and a sense of style which women still emulate decades later.\r\nIt was her role as Holly Golightly in the film Breakfast at Tiffany's that sealed her place as a top actress and an icon of the silver screen.\r\nThe big hat, cigarette holder and black dress helped the designer Hubert Givenchy become a byword for elegance.\r\nThe sale at Christies in London has on-set photos of Hepburn with her male co-star George Peppard, some autographed, along with the annotated script of the film and musical score Moon River.\r\nDirector of Christie's private collections, Adrian Hume-Sayer says the photo collection is the backbone of the sale which tells the story of Hepburn's life.\r\nHe says: \"People loved Audrey she was a phenomenon really, but in terms of pre-sale estimates there's two lots that really stand out particularly amongst the group. One of them is just behind us the Breakfast at Tiffany's script which is her annotated working script bathed in her favourite turquoise ink, you see her copying lines over from one page underlining, annotating.\"\r\nHume-Sayer explains: \"And when you look at it and look at the film you can see how one relates to the other and it sort of takes you to that moment which is fantastic and actually we've got a great collection of scripts throughout the sale which is kind of the backbone of it. It really tells the story of her career which is so wonderful. We've got My Fair Lady, Sabrina and many others as well.\"\r\nWhat makes the sale so interesting is the very personal effects that Hepburn used on a daily basis, including this Cartier compact powder and lipstick case valued at over four thousand British pounds.\r\nThe lipstick holder still has some remnants of the actual coral lip colour Hepburn used.\r\nThe more valuable items were given as gifts, such as this gold snuff box and matching lighter.\r\nThe gift was from Hepburn's co-star in My Fair Lady, Rex Harrison and alludes to their screen characters. \r\nHepburn was poor flower seller Eliza Doolittle and Harrison was professor Henry Higgins who had the job of polishing away her cockney London accent.\r\nThe back of the box is inscribed \"To Eliza Doolittle from Henry Higgins\"\r\nHepburn, a gifted ballet dancer, was brought up during the second world war.\r\nHer mother was Baroness Ella van Heemstra of the Netherlands and father was Anglo-Irish businessman Joseph Hepburn-Ruston. \r\nHepburn's mother was a noble whose family had lost their wealth in the First World War.\r\nThey were living in Holland at the time of the Nazi invasion, and Hepburn recalled being starved and digging up bulbs from the ground to eat.\r\nIt was a beginning which would make a lasting impression on the way she would look at life.\r\nTo her sons she was a mother.\r\nAccording to her youngest child, Lucca Dotti her greatest gift to them was a normal happy childhood. \r\nHepburn's sons say they never fully realised how renowned their mother was until her sad death in 1993. \r\nDotti says: \"The moment that really broke that enchantment was when she passed away and that there with the press and all the news and covers in the magazine it was like a where you find out that the world is in love with your mother. There's a hint of jealousy and little by little you understand that it's a privilege.\"\r\nAlthough Hepburn loved jewellery she was not bothered by financial value. Most of her necklaces, earrings and brooches were made of paste, like this tiara.\r\nDotti says: \"She liked the fact that they were beautiful, they were art, but they were not, you know hundreds of thousands of dollars on her.\"\r\nShe died in 1993 from colon cancer.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/1df8bc769d04dc17185a51ce26b9885d \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
