            "description": "(25 Sep 2017) Former Rep. Anthony Weiner was sentenced Monday to 21 months in prison for sexting with a 15-year-old girl in a case that rocked Hillary Clinton's campaign for the White House in the closing days of the race and may have cost her the presidency.\r\nWeiner, 53, dropped his head into his hand and wept as U.S. District Judge Denise Cote handed down her sentence. After the hearing ended and the judge left the bench, Weiner sat in his seat for several minutes, continuing to cry.\r\nIn pleading with the judge to be spared from prison, the former congressman tearfully said he was \"a very sick man for a very long time.\"\r\nThe sentencing completed the sordid downfall of the New York Democrat whose penchant for exchanging lewd messages and photos with young women destroyed his congressional career in 2011, doomed his 2013 run for mayor of New York, wrecked his marriage to Clinton's closest aide, Huma Abedin, and became entangled in the 2016 presidential campaign.\r\nWeiner pleaded guilty in May to transferring obscene material to a minor, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, for illicit contact with a North Carolina teenager. Prosecutors said he sent her porn and got her to take her clothes off and touch herself on Skype.\r\nIn imposing sentence, the judge cited a need in such a highly publicized case to \"make a statement that can protect other minors.\"\r\nCote noted that Weiner repeatedly got caught sexting and said that while he has made \"great strides\" in treatment, \"the difficulty here is that this is a very strong compulsion.\"\r\nFederal prosecutor Amanda Kramer had urged Cote to give Weiner a significant prison sentence to end his \"tragic cycle\" of sexting.\r\nWeiner wore his wedding ring to court. His parents were in the courtroom but not his wife. He and Abedin, who have a 5-year-old, are going through divorce proceedings.\r\nWeiner said nothing as he left the courthouse. He must report to prison by Nov. 6.\r\nHe was also fined $10,000. After his sentence is served, he must undergo internet monitoring. He must also enroll in a sex-offender treatment program.\r\nThe FBI was investigating Weiner's contact with the high school student when it came across emails on his laptop between Abedin and Clinton, prompting then-FBI Director James Comey to announce in late October 2016 that he was reopening the probe of Clinton's use of a private computer server.\r\nTwo days before Election Day, the FBI announced there was nothing new in the emails. But Clinton has blamed Comey's handling of the episode more than any other factor for her loss to Donald Trump.

                "title": "Weiner Gets 21 Months in Prison For Sexting",
                "description": "(25 Sep 2017) Former Rep. Anthony Weiner was sentenced Monday to 21 months in prison for sexting with a 15-year-old girl in a case that rocked Hillary Clinton's campaign for the White House in the closing days of the race and may have cost her the presidency.\r\nWeiner, 53, dropped his head into his hand and wept as U.S. District Judge Denise Cote handed down her sentence. After the hearing ended and the judge left the bench, Weiner sat in his seat for several minutes, continuing to cry.\r\nIn pleading with the judge to be spared from prison, the former congressman tearfully said he was \"a very sick man for a very long time.\"\r\nThe sentencing completed the sordid downfall of the New York Democrat whose penchant for exchanging lewd messages and photos with young women destroyed his congressional career in 2011, doomed his 2013 run for mayor of New York, wrecked his marriage to Clinton's closest aide, Huma Abedin, and became entangled in the 2016 presidential campaign.\r\nWeiner pleaded guilty in May to transferring obscene material to a minor, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, for illicit contact with a North Carolina teenager. Prosecutors said he sent her porn and got her to take her clothes off and touch herself on Skype.\r\nIn imposing sentence, the judge cited a need in such a highly publicized case to \"make a statement that can protect other minors.\"\r\nCote noted that Weiner repeatedly got caught sexting and said that while he has made \"great strides\" in treatment, \"the difficulty here is that this is a very strong compulsion.\"\r\nFederal prosecutor Amanda Kramer had urged Cote to give Weiner a significant prison sentence to end his \"tragic cycle\" of sexting.\r\nWeiner wore his wedding ring to court. His parents were in the courtroom but not his wife. He and Abedin, who have a 5-year-old, are going through divorce proceedings.\r\nWeiner said nothing as he left the courthouse. He must report to prison by Nov. 6.\r\nHe was also fined $10,000. After his sentence is served, he must undergo internet monitoring. He must also enroll in a sex-offender treatment program.\r\nThe FBI was investigating Weiner's contact with the high school student when it came across emails on his laptop between Abedin and Clinton, prompting then-FBI Director James Comey to announce in late October 2016 that he was reopening the probe of Clinton's use of a private computer server.\r\nTwo days before Election Day, the FBI announced there was nothing new in the emails. But Clinton has blamed Comey's handling of the episode more than any other factor for her loss to Donald Trump.

                "description": "(26 Sep 2017) Ten of thousands of people waited outside Thailand's Grand Palace on Monday to pay their last respects to the late King. \r\nOver 11 million people have come to mourn the death of King Bhumibol Adulyadej since he passed away on 13 October last year.\r\nThe number of people has increased dramatically this week after the Royal Household Bureau announced that this Saturday will be the final day that people would be allowed to pray in front of the Royal Urn at the Palace. \r\nThis group of mourners sitting behind the waiting line arrived at the Royal Plaza in the early hours of Monday and they are expected to wait until evening before it would be their turn to go in. \r\nThai officials said more than 64,000 people came to mourn their late King on Sunday.\r\nPreparations for the royal crematorium are now considered finished, according to General Tanasak Patimapragorn, Thailand's Deputy Prime Minister. \r\nThe design of the crematorium represents a mystical Mount Meru from Buddhist and Hindu legends where gods reside. \r\nKing Maha Vajiralongkorn will preside at an official ceremony on 18 October to install the royal nine-tier umbrella on top of the structure, signifying the finishing of the crematorium. \r\nThe funeral will be held on 26 October this year.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/57698cc73a839e5fc3a2a0a3fcf1d8cf \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
